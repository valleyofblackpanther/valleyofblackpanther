Hi I am Kaushik Chintam. I'm a Masters student at Queen Mary University Of London from the the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

These days I am interested in Quantum Computing, Proof theory, Lambda calculus, Quantum Machine Learning and Statistical Mechanics. I work in Python, C, Rust a lot, but in the past I've written plenty of C++, C#, Java, Javascript. I am particularly interested in designing quantum ansatzs and type systems for computational effects, including for quantum computation. My understanding of these subjects is influenced by functional programming and by pure and applied category theory.
